## What do you mean???

I literally mean using `Math.random()` to generate passwords. Here's what this
looks like:

```javascript title="password.js" attribution="ðŸ˜¬ this *seems* bad, right?"
// yields something like 0.4972901589263987
console.log(Math.random());
```

Not that complicated, right? It's fast, simple, and built into the JavaScript
standard library.

## Surely that can't be secure right?

Let's (for the sake of this article) put aside the concern that:

> "`Math.random()` does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do
> not use them for anything related to security. Use the Web Crypto API
> instead, and more precisely the `Crypto.getRandomValues()` method."[^1]

Before we go into analyzing the strength of the password, let's first try
passing it through a password strength checker.

A widely used password strengh checker is
[dropbox/zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) which provides "_Low-Budget
Password Strength Estimation_". This is what it has to say about the above
generated password:

There are some obvious shortcomings when it comes to analyzing the password
like this, though. For one, there are assumptions baked into `zxcvbn` like how
passwords can be _not random_ and still be secure.

If we assume that `Math.random()`'s output is random, this type of analysis
might not be really all that useful. Assuming that the amount of "randomness"
in a password is proportional to its security, we should instead try to analyze
the amount of randomness instead.

## Random Passwords

Well, if every character in the password is just some value in the random number
then we should probably figure out how many random characters there are in each
password generation.

```javascript title="character-count.js"
const sample_count = 10_000_000;

// first we find the mean of how many
// characters are in a Math.random() password
const dist = [...Array(sample_count)]
  .map(() => Math.random().toString().length)
  .reduce((m, v) => {
    m[v] = (m[v] ?? 0) + 1;
    return m;
  }, {});
```

When we run the above code to find the amount of characters in a
`Math.random()` output, we get the following distribution[^2]:

![Distribution visualization](lengths.png "Distribution of character count in `Math.random()` passwords")

We can actually find the mean random character length by running a little more
code on the calculation:

```javascript title="character-count.js"
// results in 18.270232
Object.entries(dist).reduce((sum, [k, v]) => sum + k * v, 0) / sample_count;
```

Since we know that each `Math.random()` call when turned into a string has a
`0.` prefix, we can just take two off the mean random character count,
resulting in $16.270232$ characters.

With this information, we can take the number of possible characters each
character could be (10, 0-9) and raise it to the power of this new value.

$$
{/* 10^{16.270232} \approx 1.863082129 \times 10^{16} */}
$$

This number roughly represents how many random combinations there are in the
mean `Math.random()` password.

Now compare this to just an alphanumeric password, to get the same level of
"security", you can just solve for $x$ to get the number of characters:

$$


$$

$$

x \approx 9.077386430


$$

So, a `9.07` character random alphanumeric password is roughly equivalent to a
`16.27` character `Math.random()` password, or rather the alphanumeric
passwords are $1.792391690$ times more secure per character.

## Conclusions

1. Don't actually use this in practice
2. `Math.random()` is not a "secure" source of randomness
3. Only (roughly) as secure as a `9.07` character alphanumeric password
4. If you repeat the math from earlier and include the top row symbols, a
   `Math.random()` password is around `8.759` characters long

    There are likely many ways to calculate this exactly, but an approximation
    will suffice for the sake of this article.
